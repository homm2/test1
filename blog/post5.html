                <p>As dogs age, their needs change. Providing special care and attention to your senior canine companion can help them enjoy their golden years to the fullest. Here's how to keep your older dog healthy and happy.</p>

                <h3>1. Regular Vet Check-ups</h3>
                <p>Senior dogs (typically over 7 years, though it varies by breed) should have veterinary check-ups at least twice a year. These visits can help detect age-related conditions like arthritis, kidney disease, or dental issues early, allowing for more effective treatment.</p>

                <h3>2. Tailored Diet</h3>
                <p>Older dogs often have different dietary requirements. They may need fewer calories to prevent weight gain (due to decreased activity) or special diets to support organ function (e.g., kidney-friendly food). Consult your vet for the best senior dog food options.</p>

                <h3>3. Moderate Exercise</h3>
                <p>While an older dog might not be able to run miles anymore, regular, gentle exercise is still crucial. Short, frequent walks can help maintain muscle mass, joint flexibility, and mental stimulation. Avoid strenuous activities that could put stress on their joints.</p>

                <h3>4. Joint Support</h3>
                <p>Arthritis is common in senior dogs. Consider supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin, or omega-3 fatty acids, under veterinary guidance. A comfortable, orthopedic bed can also provide much-needed relief for aching joints.</p>

                <h3>5. Mental Stimulation</h3>
                <p>Keep your senior dog's mind active with puzzle toys, gentle training sessions, or new scents on walks. Mental engagement can help slow cognitive decline and keep them engaged with their environment.</p>

                <h3>6. Comfort and Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Make your home senior-friendly. Ramps for beds or cars, non-slip mats on slippery floors, and easily accessible food and water bowls can significantly improve their quality of life.</p>
