                <p>Litter box issues are one of the most frustrating problems for cat owners, but they're also one of the most common reasons cats are relinquished to shelters. Understanding why your cat might be avoiding the litter box is the first step to solving the problem.</p>

                <h3>1. Not Enough Litter Boxes</h3>
                <p>The general rule of thumb is one litter box per cat, plus one extra. If you have multiple cats and only one litter box, some cats might feel territorial or simply not have a clean place to go.</p>

                <h3>2. Dirty Litter Box</h3>
                <p>Cats are fastidious creatures. If their litter box isn't scooped at least once a day (preferably twice), they might decide it's too dirty and find somewhere else to relieve themselves. Regular cleaning, including a full litter change and washing the box, is essential.</p>

                <h3>3. Wrong Type of Litter</h3>
                <p>Some cats are particular about the type of litter. Scented litters can be off-putting to a cat's sensitive nose, and some textures might be uncomfortable for their paws. Experiment with different unscented, fine-grained litters until you find one your cat prefers.</p>

                <h3>4. Location, Location, Location</h3>
                <p>Is the litter box in a high-traffic area, next to a noisy appliance, or in a place that's hard for your cat to access? Cats prefer quiet, private, and easily accessible locations for their litter box. Avoid placing it near their food and water bowls.</p>

                <h3>5. Size and Type of Box</h3>
                <p>A litter box should be large enough for your cat to comfortably turn around in. Some cats prefer open boxes, while others prefer covered ones. If your cat is older or has mobility issues, a box with lower sides might be necessary.</p>

                <h3>6. Medical Issues</h3>
                <p>If your cat suddenly starts avoiding the litter box, the first step should always be a vet visit. Urinary tract infections, kidney disease, arthritis, and other medical conditions can cause a cat to associate pain with the litter box.</p>

                <h3>7. Stress and Anxiety</h3>
                <p>Changes in the household (new pet, new baby, moving), inter-cat aggression, or other stressors can cause a cat to act out. Identifying and addressing the source of stress can help resolve the litter box problem.</p>
