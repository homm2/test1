                <p>Bringing a new puppy home is an exciting experience, but it also comes with a lot of responsibility. Proper training from a young age is essential for a well-behaved and happy dog. Here are some fundamental tips for beginners.</p>

                <h3>1. Start with Socialization</h3>
                <p>Socialization is the process of exposing your puppy to various sights, sounds, and other animals in a positive way. Between 3 and 16 weeks of age is a critical window for socialization. Introduce your puppy to new people, vaccinated dogs, and different environments to help them grow into a confident, well-adjusted adult.</p>

                <h3>2. Use Positive Reinforcement</h3>
                <p>Positive reinforcement is the most effective and humane training method. Reward your puppy with treats, praise, or toys immediately after they perform a desired behavior. This makes them more likely to repeat the behavior in the future. Avoid punishment, as it can lead to fear and anxiety.</p>

                <h3>3. Master Basic Commands</h3>
                <p>Start with simple commands like "Sit," "Stay," "Come," and "Down." Keep training sessions short and fun, especially for young puppies with short attention spans. Consistency is key, so make sure everyone in the household uses the same commands and rules.</p>

                <h3>4. House Training is a Priority</h3>
                <p>House training requires patience and consistency. Take your puppy out frequently, especially after waking up, after playing, and after eating. Choose a designated potty spot and reward your puppy enthusiastically every time they go in the right place. Expect accidents and clean them up with an enzymatic cleaner to prevent remarking.</p>

                <h3>5. Crate Training</h3>
                <p>A crate can be a safe, den-like space for your puppy and a valuable tool for house training and preventing destructive behavior. Introduce the crate in a positive way with treats and toys, and never use it as a form of punishment.</p>
