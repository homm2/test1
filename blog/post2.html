                <p>Cats are mysterious creatures, and their behavior can often be puzzling. Understanding what your cat is trying to tell you is key to a happy relationship. Here are 10 common cat behaviors and their meanings.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Purring</h3>
                <p>Most people associate purring with happiness, and while that's often true, cats also purr to comfort themselves when they are scared or in pain. Pay attention to the context to understand the message.</p>

                <h3>2. Kneading</h3>
                <p>Often called "making biscuits," kneading is a behavior kittens use to stimulate milk flow from their mother. In adult cats, it's a sign of contentment, comfort, and adoration for their owners.</p>

                <h3>3. Rubbing Against You</h3>
                <p>When a cat rubs its cheeks on you, it's marking you as its territory. Cats have scent glands on their faces, and this behavior is a sign of affection and ownership.</p>

                <h3>4. Slow Blinking</h3>
                <p>Often called a "kitty kiss," a slow blink is a sign of trust and affection. If a cat slow-blinks at you, try returning the gesture to show you are not a threat.</p>

                <h3>5. Tail Position</h3>
                <p>A cat's tail is a great indicator of its mood. A tail held high is a sign of a happy, confident cat. A twitching tail can mean excitement or anxiety, while a tucked tail signifies fear.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Chattering</h3>
                <p>You might see your cat chattering its teeth while looking out the window at a bird. This is believed to be a sign of frustration and excitement, mimicking a killing bite.</p>

                <h3>7. Hissing</h3>
                <p>Hissing is an unmistakable sign that your cat feels threatened or unhappy. It's a clear warning to back off.</p>

                <h3>8. Bringing You "Gifts"</h3>
                <p>When your cat brings you a dead mouse or a toy, it's not trying to be gross. It's sharing its prey with you, an instinctual behavior that shows it considers you part of its family.</p>

                <h3>9. Sleeping in a Ball vs. Stretched Out</h3>
                <p>A cat sleeping curled up in a tight ball is conserving body heat. A cat sleeping stretched out is relaxed and feels safe in its environment.</p>

                <h3>10. Showing Their Belly</h3>
                <p>The belly is a cat's most vulnerable area. If your cat rolls over and shows you its belly, it's the ultimate sign of trust. But be warned—it's not always an invitation for a belly rub!</p>
