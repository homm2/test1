# Cat Photo Gallery

## Overview

This project is a simple, beautiful, and responsive cat photo gallery. It is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external frameworks. The goal is to create a visually appealing and interactive experience for users who love cats.

## Design and Features

### Visual Design

*   **Layout**: A responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
*   **Color Palette**: A vibrant and energetic color palette with a wide range of hues and concentrations.
*   **Typography**: Expressive and relevant typography to create a clear visual hierarchy. Hero text, section headlines, and other elements will have distinct font sizes and styles.
*   **Texture**: A subtle noise texture on the main background to add a premium, tactile feel.
*   **Visual Effects**: Multi-layered drop shadows to create a sense of depth. Each photo card will have a soft, deep shadow to look "lifted."
*   **Iconography**: Modern, interactive icons to enhance user understanding and navigation.
*   **Interactivity**: Interactive elements like buttons and image carousels will have a "glow" effect created with shadows and elegant use of color.

### Features

*   **Responsive Photo Grid**: A grid of cat photos that adjusts its layout based on the screen size.
*   **Image Carousel**: Clicking on a photo opens it in a full-screen carousel, allowing users to navigate between photos.
*   **Interactive Header**: A header with a search bar and navigation links.
*   **Modern Components**: The application will use Web Components to create encapsulated, reusable UI elements.

## Current Plan

*   **Step 1: Create `blueprint.md`**: Document the project overview, design, features, and the plan for the current changes.
*   **Step 2: Update `index.html`**: Create the basic HTML structure for the cat photo gallery, including a header, a main content area for the photo grid, and a footer.
*   **Step 3: Update `style.css`**: Add modern CSS to style the gallery, including a responsive grid layout, color palette, typography, and visual effects.
*   **Step 4: Update `main.js`**: Add JavaScript to implement the interactive features, such as the image carousel.
